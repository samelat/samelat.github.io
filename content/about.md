Hi, my name is Gaston Traberg, but those who know me call me Samelat. I've been a Security Researcher for the last around 15 years and developer of my own projects when my kids give me some time XD (because not all is about destruction, right?).
From 2017 I started researching DeFi, Crypto and Decentralized technologies in general and from then I cannot stop getting deep in this really interesting world.

I created this space to write down all my research and keep it accessible not just for me but for anyone :).

I also invite you to the blog of [CaMaGri](https://camagri.github.io/es/)
